# swv-series-alt-dnc

> Effect for alternative calulation of DNC results for a Sailwave series

## Examples

View the files in the examples folder for [before](./examples/base.html) and
[after](./examples/alt-dnc.html).  You need to open them in a browser with
JavaScript enabled because it all happens in the front end.

## Development

Download and install.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/os3w/swv-series-alt-dnc.git
$ npm install
```

Build - the file for the browser or importing to Sailwave is `index.min.js`.

```console
$ npm run build
```

Lint and format.

```console
$ npm run lint:fix
```

Unit tests (need work and more coverage).

```console
$ npm run test:unit
```
